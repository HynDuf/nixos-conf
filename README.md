# Yoru - NixOS dotfiles

This is heavily taken from [Aqu4holic - NixOS Configs](https://github.com/aqu4holic/yuki)

## Firefox Custom `chrome` CSS

## Add `copyq` shortcuts for "Show the tray menu" as Super + Shift + V

The old way of using `sxhkd` to map `copyq menu` to Super + Shift + V is deprecated. As it doesn't work properly on my NixOS anymore.
