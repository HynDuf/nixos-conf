## Find nerd fonts
Search for the name of the nerd font (to install with NixOS):
[https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts).

Then, use the name on the URL to install it with NixOS.

## Firefox Custom `chrome` CSS

## Add `copyq` shortcuts for "Show the tray menu" as Super + Shift + V

The old way of using `sxhkd` to map `copyq menu` to Super + Shift + V is deprecated. As it doesn't work properly on my NixOS anymore.
